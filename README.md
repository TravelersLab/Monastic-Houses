# Monastic-Houses

## Web Scraper

The Web Scraper which pulls the Monastic Houses in England dataset (w corresponding sources) [from this site](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_monastic_houses_in_England&action=info) is contained
within `0-scraper.R`, located [here](code/0-scraper.R)

Any future work will be done in the code directory; I suspect there'll be
some more work done soon.

Also, see the [Data Dictionary](data/datadict.md) for an explanation of the
columns.
